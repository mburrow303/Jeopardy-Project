[Jeopardy Rubric](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wid2efXlNyuhEBcKcZtYFAUCaF9wTDm0YT2cU8ZP_gY/edit?usp=sharing)

## Style Guide
- Each ticket may have specific requirements to complete a task. Anything outside of stated requirements can be flexible.
- Once a ticket is completed, commit your code to your repo with a commit message **[ticket number] [status]**
  - ex: `git commit -m "U1_01 Completed"`
    - This would detail that The Landing Page portion has been completed.
- All `title` elements within the HTML documents should note the respective file.
